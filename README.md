# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze Pyber rideshare data to understand the passenger volume and fare indicators of the city type in which Pyber operates. Create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to rideshare services and determine affordability in underserved areas.
### Result
Through the pie chart below, we can know that urban cities have the most amount of rides and rural cities have the least amount of rides.

Through the pie chart below, we can know that urban cities have the most amount of drivers and rural cities have the least amount of drivers.

Through the pie chart below, we can know that urban cities have the most amount of fares and rural cities have the least amount of fares.

From this frame, we can analyze the following key points:
* Rural cities has the least amount of drivers, rides and total fares.
* Urban cities have the most amount of drivers, rides and total fares.
* Suburban cities are in the middle having the 2nd most drivers, rides and total fares.
* Rural cities have the least number of drivers, rides and fares, but the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver are the highest.
* Urban cities have the most drivers, rides and fares, but they have the lowest average fare per ride and the lowest fare per driver.

According to our data, we can judge what kind of fare will be charged based on the type of city the passenger travels in. Although we haven't explored every city, we still know the fares from different cities very well. Based on the type of city each week, this is enough information to determine the rate to be charged after we can classify the type of city where consumers live. In short, we can effectively say that rural areas will get higher fares, because there are fewer workers who come to the area, the travel time and distance are likely to be longer, thus making the average ticket per ride and driver The price becomes the highest among all city types.
## Summary
1. According to the type of city in which they usually work, drivers are assigned to different types of cities.
2. In urban cities, the charge per mile is higher because the trip is likely to be shorter and the driverâ€™s income per trip is not high.
3. Increase the number of drivers in rural areas to ensure that there are enough drivers to meet the ride demand.
